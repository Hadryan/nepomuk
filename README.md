# Nepomuk font family

These are two text fonts, regular and italic, with a slightly awkward family name. (Have you ever heard of Johan Nepomuk David?) They are inspired by the text fonts used by Henle in old plate engravings. They're nowhere near finished, but since they found their way into some online font catalogs for music notation, I'll make them available here once more. Feel free to fork this repo if you want to make your own improvements.

The fonts in this archive are free to use for everybody. They're licensed under the [SIL Open Font License](http://scripts.sil.org/ofl).
