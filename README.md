# Nepomuk font family

The fonts in this archive are free to use for everybody. I've been developing them over the last few years. They're not finished, but I cannot afford to spend any more time tweaking and refining them. If you'd like to use or even develop them, you're welcome, go for it! Do whatever you like.

The fonts are licensed under the [SIL Open Font License](http://scripts.sil.org/ofl).

### A FEW NOTES

Nepomuk and Nepomuk Regular are text fonts reminiscent of the italic font used in music published by G. Henle Verlag. I wanted Henle-style italics for my engravings so I created them, and a regular face as well. But I'm not a professional type designer, so these are still quite rough. Especially spacing would dearly need some refinement. And it would be good to have a bold face as well. I used them anyway.
